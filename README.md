## About
This code is no longer being actively maintained and is part of my personal project archives. The project was initiated in late 2019 but had to be abandoned shortly afterwards due to my scheduling constraints.

A database design file can be found in the root directory for reference purposes.

It is worth noting that the project remains incomplete and requires additional development efforts to reach its intended state.
