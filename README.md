## About
The project was intended to provide a private group functionality similar to that of Facebook. 

The project was initiated in late 2019 with the aim of creating a web application that would allow users to create and manage a private group, invite members, and share posts and other media within the group. 

However, due to scheduling conflicts and other commitments, the project was eventually abandoned and is no longer being actively maintained. 

While a database design file can still be found in the project's root directory, it is worth noting that the project remains incomplete and would require significant development efforts to reach its intended functionality.
